# jpd-express-error

**jpd-express-error** is a lightweight utility package designed to standardize error handling in Express microservices.  
It ensures consistent error responses, typed messages, and structured error propagation across your services.


---


## Features
- **Typed Messages** ‚Üí Success and error messages are strongly typed for better maintainability.
- **Standardized API Responses** ‚Üí Ensures uniform response structures across all services.
- **Custom Error Handling** ‚Üí Provides a centralized `AppError` class for better error propagation.
- **Express & Microservices-Friendly** ‚Üí Built to simplify error management in Express applications.

## Installation

```sh
npm install jpd-express-error
```

## Usage  

### Handling success responses or throw an error

Use `ApiResponse.success()` to return a standardized success response. 
Use `handleError();` to return a standardized error response.   


```ts
/*
  Controller
*/

import { Request, Response } from 'express';
import { handleError, ApiResponse, AppError } from 'jpd-express-error';
import { createUserService } from '@/services/userService';

import { Request, Response } from 'express';
import { handleError, ApiResponse, AppError } from 'jpd-express-error';
import { createUserService } from '@/services/userService';

export const createUser = async (req: Request, res: Response): Promise<void> => {
  try {
    const { name, email, password } = req.body;

    if (!name || !email || !password) {
      throw new AppError('Missing required fields', 400);
    }

    const userData = { name, email, password };
    const user = await createUserService(userData);

    // Send a standardized success response
    res.status(201).json(ApiResponse.success('User created successfully', user));
  } catch (error: any) {
    handleError(error, res);
  }
};

```


### Throwing Errors from Database Models  

When an error occurs in the database, use `AppError` to propagate it to the service or controller.  
The controller will catch the error and format it correctly using `handleError()`.  

#### Example: Throwing an error in a database model  
```ts
import { PrismaClientKnownRequestError } from '@prisma/client/runtime/library';
import { AppError } from 'jpd-express-error';

export const store = async (data: Omit<User, "id">): Promise<User> => {
  try {
    // 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create the resource in the database
    const response = await prisma.user.create(data);
    return response;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof PrismaClientKnownRequestError) {
      if (error.code === 'P2002') {
        throw new AppError('Resource already exists');
      }
    }
    throw error;
  }
};
```

Prisma-Specific Errors

When working with Prisma, you might encounter specific error codes.
These errors can be caught and handled using AppError for proper error propagation.

	‚Ä¢	P2002 ‚Üí Unique constraint failed (e.g., trying to insert a duplicate email).
	‚Ä¢	P2003 ‚Üí Foreign key constraint failed (e.g., trying to delete a referenced record).
	‚Ä¢	P2025 ‚Üí Record not found (e.g., trying to update or delete a record that does not exist).
	‚Ä¢	P2014 ‚Üí Nested delete or disconnect is not allowed if parent record is required.
	‚Ä¢	P2016 ‚Üí Query interpretation error (e.g., invalid field or relation used in query).
	‚Ä¢	P2017 ‚Üí Related record not found (e.g., relation inconsistency).
	‚Ä¢	P2018 ‚Üí Required connected records not found.
	‚Ä¢	P2022 ‚Üí Database constraint violation (e.g., check constraint failed).
	‚Ä¢	P2023 ‚Üí Invalid database input (e.g., sending incorrect values).
	‚Ä¢	P2024 ‚Üí Database connection timeout or issues with the database server.
